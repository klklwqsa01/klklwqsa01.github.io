					<h2>1. Urbanisation</h2>
					<p>
					Rapid urbanisation in India during the recent decades has given rise to a number of environmental problems such as water supply, wastewater generation and its collection, treatment and disposal. Many towns and cities which came up on the banks of rivers have not given a proper thought to problem of wastewater, severage, etc. In urban areas, water is tapped for domestic and industrial use from rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, wells, etc. Nearly 80% of the water supplied for domestic use passes out as wastewater. In most cases, this wastewater is let out untreated and causes large scale pollution of the surface water.<br><br>
					A part of it percolates into the ground and contaminates the ground water. Class I cities (cities with population above one lakh) generate as much as 16,662 Mid (Million litres per day) of wastewater. About 70% of the population of class I cities is provided with sewerage facility. The Ganga river basin contributes about one-third of the total wastewater of India.
					</p><br>
					<h2>2. industries</h2>
					<p> 
					Most Indian rivers and other sources of fresh water are polluted by industrial wastes or effluents. All these industrial wastes are toxic to life forms that consume this water. The total wastewater generated from all major industrial sources is 83,048 MId which includes 66,700 Mid of cooling water generated from thermal power plants. Out of remaining 16,348 mid of wastewater, thermal power plants generate another 7,275 Mid as boiler blow down water and overflow from ash ponds. Engineering industries comprise the second largest generator of wastewater in terms of volume. Under this category the major polluting industries are electroplating units.<br><br>
					The other significant contributors of wastewater are paper mills, steel plants, textile and sugar industries. The major contributors of pollution in terms of organic load are distilleries followed by paper mills. Figure 9.8 shows the volume of wastewater from different industries in India.
					</p><br>
					<h2>3. Agricultural runoff and improper agricultural practices</h2>
					<p>Traces of fertilizers and pesticides are wasted into the nearest water-bodies at the onset of the monsoons or whenever there are heavy showers. As the point of entry of such agricultural inputs is diffused throughout the river basin, they are termed as non-point sources of pollution. Although irrigation has increased considerably in the country, little precious has been done to tackle the problem of the high salinity return water. This is the situation in Punjab and Haryana. In Haryana, the 40 km long drain No. 8 pours 250,000 kg/day of chlorides into the Yamuna to raise the chloride concentration in the river from 32 mg per litre just upstream of the drain confluence to 150 mg per litre just downstream of it. And most of these chlorides are from agricultural return flows.
					</p><br>
					<h2>4. Withdrawal of Water</h2>
					<p>Indian rivers, particularly the Himalayan Rivers, have plenty of water in their upper course. They are, however, starved of water when they enter the plain area. Irrigation canals whisk away clean water soon after the rivers reach the plains, denying water to flow in the river downstream.<br><br>
					What flows into the river is water trickling in from small insignificant streams and drains carrying untreated sewage and effluents. The river-turned drain flow downstream with little or no fresh water unless a large river augments the depleted flows.<br><br>
					As the quantity of fresh water in the river is negligibly small, pollution—either from urban and rural areas, industries or even natural forms of pollution—cannot get diluted and its ill effects are not reduced. The Yamuna has almost no water at Tajewala in Haryana where the Eastern Yamuna Canal and the Western Yamuna Canal abstract all the water for irrigation.
					</p><br>
					<h2>5. religious and social practices</h2>
					<p>
					Religious faith and social practices also add to pollution of our river waters. Carcasses of cattle and other animals are disposed in the rivers. Dead bodies are cremated on the river banks. Partially burnt bodies are also flung into the river. All this is done as a matter of religious faith and in keeping with ancient rituals. These practices pollute the river water and adversely affect the water quality. Mass bathing in a river during religious festivals is another environmentally harmful practice. Studies have revealed that the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) goes up drastically when thousands of people simultaneously take a ‘holy dip’. Religious practices also demand that offerings from a puja be immersed in a river. It is now common to see people immersing offerings in plastic bags. Plastic bags are very dangerous and further add to the pollution load of the river.

				<h1>Effects of Water Scarcity</h1>

					<b>• Lack of Access to Drinking Water: </b>The biggest problem that happens when you have water scarcity is that people are not able to get fresh, clean drinking water. The human body can only go so long without water, and a lack of drinking water can result in a number of other problems, which we discuss below.<br><br>
					<b>• Hunger: </b>If there is no water that can be used in order to help water the crops, then you are going to have people that are going hungry. Animals will also die, which will result in a lack of meat as well. Water scarcity, in short, causes starvation to occur en masse for both people and animals that are located in the area.<br><br>
					<b>• Lack of Education: </b>Water scarcity makes it difficult for people to get the education that they need or that they deserve. Why? Mainly, because those children are either too sick to go to school (which we will discuss below), or they are working to help get water to the home and the family.<br><br>
					<b>• Diseases: </b>If you don’t have clean water access, then you will be more likely to get diseases from the water that you do have. Whether you’re drinking the water or using it for bathing, those diseases will get into the body and, in a number of cases, the people carrying those diseases will pass away.<br><br>
					<b>• Sanitation Issues: </b>Without access to clean water, there is no way to clean food, dishes, or people. When people are not given access to proper sanitation, disease (which we talked about above) ends up becoming much more of an issue than it would have been otherwise. It also causes mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.<br><br>
					<b>• Poverty: </b>All in all, people who are dealing with water scarcity are often stuck in poverty as well. These people are not able to get the resources that they need in order to be able to thrive, and instead are just barely surviving through these difficult times.
